# Python: 50five

Python 3 package to retrieve EV charger data from 50five

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install fiftyfive
```

## WARNING

50five uses separate endpoints depending on the market (belux, nl, de, ...). As
I myself only have access to an account in the belux market, I cannot do any
testing/reverse engineering on the other markets, so I can't give any guarantee
anything will work for accounts in them.
